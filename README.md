# ResNet-implementation
-----
### This repository contains a deployable ResNet module made with pytorch (python 3.9) (ResNet implementation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkNIBBBvcPs)
### These are the things you need for it work:
- #### pytorch
- #### matplotlib
- #### time
- #### numpy
------
#### ResNet (Residual Neural Network) is mainly used for image classification.
#### It won the ImageNet Challenge 2015 and has been much improved since then.
#### The explanation can be found in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf
